# blog

This is a personal blog where I can upload a photo with a caption every day. The frontend is written in Svelte using SvelteKit. It uses a PostgreSQL database to store the posts, and a Cloudflare-based S3 service to store the image files.

## Development Server

To run the site locally, run

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production Build

To create a production build, run
